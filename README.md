# Firebase Chat
A simple chat app to learn some new technologies. Users can create an account, log in, and chat in a global chat room with realtime updates.

This was my first time using Typescript which was challenging but also rewarding.

## Technologies/Libraries
React, Firebase, Typescript, Material UI, React Router
